# Cursor Rules Implementation PRD

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive set of cursor rules for code quality and maintainability in a modern development environment. The implementation will include ESLint rules for JavaScript/TypeScript and Pylint rules for Python, focusing on file size limits and code organization.

## Core Requirements

1. ESLint Configuration
   - Implement custom ESLint rule for 200-line maximum file size
   - Configure rule to ignore comments, blank lines, and imports
   - Provide helpful refactoring suggestions in error messages
   - Integrate with Cursor AI's "Fix in Chat" feature

2. Python/Pylint Configuration
   - Create custom Pylint plugin matching ESLint functionality
   - Implement same 200-line limit with similar exclusions
   - Ensure compatibility with Python best practices
   - Add specific refactoring recommendations

3. Project Structure
   - Create cursor_project_rules directory as knowledge base
   - Implement implementation-plan.mdc for feature tracking
   - Set up configuration files for both ESLint and Pylint
   - Create documentation for rule exceptions and usage

4. Integration Features
   - Enable automatic function extraction suggestions
   - Implement utility module identification
   - Add class organization recommendations
   - Create templates for common refactoring patterns

## Technical Requirements

1. File Organization
   - cursor_project_rules/ directory structure
   - ESLint plugin implementation
   - Pylint plugin implementation
   - Documentation and examples

2. Configuration Files
   - .eslintrc.js with custom rules
   - pylintrc with custom plugin
   - package.json for JavaScript dependencies
   - requirements.txt for Python dependencies

3. Rule Implementation
   - Line counting logic for both languages
   - Comment and import detection
   - Blank line handling
   - Exception management

4. Documentation
   - Setup instructions
   - Usage guidelines
   - Exception documentation
   - Best practices

## Success Criteria
1. All new files adhere to 200-line limit
2. Existing files have clear refactoring paths
3. Integration with Cursor AI works seamlessly
4. Developers receive helpful, actionable feedback
5. Rules are consistently enforced across languages
